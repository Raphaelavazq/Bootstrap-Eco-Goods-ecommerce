# EcoGoods E-Commerce

This project, EcoGoods E-Commerce, was developed as part of an exercise for my bootcamp at Beam Institute of Technology. Through this exercise, I learned how to rapidly prototype a responsive and user-friendly landing page using Bootstrap. The project involved creating a cohesive layout with a sticky navigation bar, hero section, product cards, carousel for testimonials, and a contact form. This experience enhanced my understanding of Bootstrap components, CSS customization, and the importance of responsive design in web development.

## My Process

This project was developed to practice rapid prototyping with Bootstrap, focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly e-commerce landing page.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5.3

### What I Learned

This project provided practical experience in using Bootstrap for rapid prototyping, creating responsive layouts, and customizing Bootstrap components with CSS. Key learnings include:

- Implementing a sticky navigation bar
- Creating a hero section with a call-to-action
- Designing product cards with hover effects
- Implementing a carousel for testimonials
- Building a responsive contact form

### Continued Development

As I continue to develop this project, I aim to:
